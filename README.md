# Real-Time Sign Language Detection using YOLOv5
# Overview
This project aims to develop a robust real-time sign language detection system utilizing the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. The system is designed to interpret and recognize various sign language gestures from live video feeds, enabling effective communication between deaf and mute individuals and the broader community.
# Motivation
Sign language is a vital communication tool for deaf and mute individuals. However, the lack of widespread understanding of sign language in the general population can create communication barriers. This project seeks to bridge this gap by providing a real-time sign language recognition system that can interpret sign gestures instantly, making communication more accessible and inclusive.
